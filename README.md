# ffmpeg-converter

To get this working on your system you need to place the shell file in the home directory so in this case you would 

> mv ff.sh ~

then in your .bashrc file you add an alias at your alias list.

> alias ff='bash ~/reno_ffmpeg.sh'

You would then need to source your .bashrc file in order to apply the changes

> source .bashrc
